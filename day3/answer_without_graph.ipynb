            "Harry Potter was first introduced in the novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (1997; also published as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone), as an orphan who is mistreated by his guardian aunt and uncle and their son. Harry and those who side with him—including some of his teachers, several classmates, and other members of the wizarding community—are forced on multiple occasions to battle Voldemort and his disciples, including the Malfoy family. In the fourth volume, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), Voldemort regains his body and former strength through a magic ritual, and thereafter his army greatly increases in number. Together, the book and movie series spawned a huge amount of related merchandise, and in 2010 a theme park inspired by the franchise opened in the United States.\n",
            " Although at first feeble and living as a parasite in a follower’s body, Voldemort makes attempts on Harry’s life beginning in the first book and continuing throughout the series.\n",
